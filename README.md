# HEX-game 
- Hex is a two player abstract strategy board game in which players attempt to connect opposite sides of a hexagonal board.
Each player is assigned a pair of opposite sides of the board which they must try to connect by taking turns placing a stone 
of their color onto any empty space. Once placed, the stones are unable to be moved or removed. A player wins when they 
successfully connect their sides together through a chain of adjacent stones. Draws are impossible in Hex due to the topology 
of the game board.
- The game uses a simlulation called montecarlo which is based on minimax algorithm. Minimax algorithm is used in many games 
such as tic tac toe ,chess and connect four.
- The algorithm goes throw all possible places and measure the value related to moving towards this place, then it measures the consequences of all moves by the opponent and so on.
- The data structure used in this algorithm is Union-Find data structure. Union-Find data structure is actually a forest where each subset is represented by a tree.
